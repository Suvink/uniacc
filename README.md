## Overview
If you are from an area far away from where the university that you are applying to , you are going to need an place to accommodate. And you need to make sure that these places satisfy your requirements. For example the distance & time to the university, monthly payments, food/water, safety etc. Our app enables consumers to look into all the details of the available boarding places along with reviews of the formal residencies. Plus our app will enable consumers to look through the prices of each boarding place and select one suitable for them. Improve communications with notifications and drive student engagement with a beautiful, and intuitive user interface. UniAcc is an app designed especially for university students in Sri Lanka who leave their hometowns to other cities to pursue their higher studies. They no more have to be worried about searching and tracking down for a place to be boarded months before the academics start. Because the perfect boarding or hostel facilities for a reasonable and an affordable fee will be just a finger tip away. The tenants are able to choose from a number of options according to their needs and budget. They are able to communicate and negotiate with the landlords as their contact details are available in the app. And once the tenants have reserved the boarding place/hostel, they are also able to make payments online through the app itself. The only app that caters boarding house locator for the users to search all the closest dormitories using the Global Positioning System or GPS, display their geographical information, show the available facilities and services such as bathrooms, gender-specific rooms, with a security guard and provision for pets. It also includes directory lists of boarding houses where they can search the contact information. The mobility of this application makes it more user-friendly and not time-consuming. Hence, it helps the users to be more productive and cautious at the same time in finding the right place for them.

## Installation Guidelines
Use the flutter run command to run your Flutter app on a connected device or simulator.
To run your app from the command-line:
Open a terminal and change directories to the root of your app (the same directory that contains the pubspec.yaml file for your project).
Run the following command. Once the flutter tool is running, if you change the app’s source code, you can hit r to hot-reload your application (updating the source on the fly without actually restarting the entire app).
`$ cd myapp`
`$ flutter run`
If more than one device is connected, use the flutter devices command to get their IDs, and then `flutter run -d deviceID` to run your app.

## Description

“Alone, we can do so little; together, we can do so much” – Helen Keller.

We believe in the power of people. You and I, as individuals, do great things. But did you know that we do greater things when we come together. If I ask anyone, “Do you like helping people?”, the morality answer is always, “Yes”. Of course, everyone wants to help everyone else. Do you have the time? Yes. Do you have the will? Yes. Do you care about your community? Yes. But really, do you have the patience to sit for hours on your computer? To search on countless websites for volunteer experiences? To apply through a long chain of emails only to find out that the time doesn’t work for you? Yeah, we don’t think so. 

That’s where Voluny comes in and solves this problem.

So… what’s our goal? Our goal is simple, just like how we want our app to be, because let’s be real, finding volunteer experiences should not be painful or stressful or take up your whole day. We don’t believe in making users sign up or commit to anything until they find what they are looking for. We want the user experience to be seamless. We want them to focus on just one thing that matters: looking for the volunteer opportunities they love. 

<p align="center">

As the volunteer, the decision is all yours. Apply to 1, 2 or 10 experiences you want. No one is stopping you. We can’t. You can join, search, and apply for volunteer experiences within a few minutes. In addition, we created a variety of categories including Children, Pets, Homeless, Education and more. It is important that we let you have the flexibility to choose your cause and the volunteer experiences you wish to apply–giving total control to you.

The other goal of Voluny is to make the user experience seamless, without any confusion. We care about your experience, that’s why it’s important for us to design a seamless UX management tool that only shows you what you want to know. After you apply, you can easily keep track of your applications to see if you are a good match to what the organization is looking for, receive all the information you need to start without having to contact back and forth with the organizations.

To ensure that everyone has the best experience, we also created a rating system to help you express yourself. The ratings will be seen by everyone and will help future volunteers to understand more about the experience they had with the organization and easily decide where they want to volunteer next.

We understand that as a recruiter, you already have enough things to worry about. With our app as the recruiter, who represents the organization, you can post new volunteer experiences within minutes without complicated hassles. The recruiter can manage current or past listings through the recruiter portal.

Our intention is to make things quick and simple. It is important that making decision should not take away your precious time. That’s why we make it simple for you to decide if the candidate is a good match by simply clicking “Accept” or “Decline” after you preview their information. With our easy managing tool, you will be able to edit, delete or modify your listing, as well as having an overview of your volunteer experience.

With user-friendly and elegant UI, this quick and easy to use app should be a go-to Volunteer app for everyone. Volunteering made simple, that’s our goal. Let’s volunteer together!
